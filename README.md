# envirohypno

EnviroHypno is a tool that lets users redefine their relationship with technology through the use of sound and the act of field recording. EnviroHypno is for individuals who are hesitant about technology's place in society and wish to take control of our future: those of us "...who are constantly mandated to get on board with a plan of the future drafted without our input or consent, yet who know in our bodies and spirits of technologies far wiser than products of Silicon Valley"(Zhang n.p.).

How does this tool do that? EnviroHypno asks the users to record short audio clips to create auditory art through the manipulation/control of their external environment -- rather than through the digital interface. In this way, the tool  'invertsâ€™ the recording/production of sound by redefining technology's place in the creative process. Overall, we are using our physical space to control the technologies -- instead of vice-versa.

Step 1: Choose a location you'd like to utalize in this creative process <br>
Step 2: Record some sounds. It's generally best if there 3-10 secs long. <br>
Step 3: Press 'MIX' Find somewhere comfortable within that area to relax. <br>
Step 4: Listen closely to the repetition, maybe even lose yourself within it. <br>
Step 5: Document the methods used to achieved your audio art in the recipe page <br>
Step 6: Continue contributing to the recreation of our relationship with tech.

Design Process + References: <br>

My design process began with reading and researching communities that are prevelant within my life. As this tool caters towards indivudals being strung along towards future of advancing technology without consent -- it should be clarified that I am privledged to be able to study technology and (while I'm not a tech giant) I therefore have the capabilities to sway our technological trajectory: something other people within this community may not have the able to do. That being said, I looked to Design Justice Principles, Alice Yuan Zhang, Annie Levin, Community Tech NY and others in order to guide my design process. I decided to use audio as the main medium to migitate technologies' dependency on visual media. Another guiding factor of my design process was researching hypnosis practices a bit, as I believe the conceptual basis of it is interesting to compare to the overall notion of control within digital and technological space -- however, this is ultimately an ongoing/unfinished thought.

Some next steps:<br>
-Connecting the website to a database and coding a minimal 'forum' type user experience so that people can share their sound recipes.<br>
-Adding more random sound prompts to the info page<br>
-Use this tool to connect with more people and further refine the user experience and social message
